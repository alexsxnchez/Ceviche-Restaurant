# HTTP5103 JavaScript Project - Ceviche Restaurant

## My Contribution
#### Alexis Arevalo: Menu (pages - menu.html)

- Designed the menu page in diffrent sections. In each section there are various dishes that associate with the section.
- Used Javascript to listen when a user clicks a section name in the navigation bar, they are scrolled down to the matched section.

#### Alexis Arevalo: Location (pages- location.html)

- Used the goodgle API to retrive a map and markers to set where each location is
- Created a function to listen when a user clicks a specific address, the map will zoom and set its center on the location.
